# library-database
The term project for this Software Engineering course was to build a software application that was capable of storing and evaluating an entire database of books.

The main topics covered in this project were:

    - designing/implementing a database in MySQL
    - designing/developing a UI to interact with the database
    - designing/developing the interface between the UI and the database
    - retrieving data from the internet to populate information on books
    - scanning webpages for relevant data using regex
    - caching data to significantly improve load times of libraries
    - multi-threading: removing all network and worker processes to different threads leaving main UI thread responsive

Main runnable class is Driver.java, this will launch the library GUI.
